# IPQ PYNQ Utilities

This is a project which aims to improve the life of those using PYNQ. More specifically those using PYNQ with the ZCU208, which comes with some challenges: Currently the main responsibility of this project is to configure the PLLs on the CLK104 board, which would otherwise require the use of the "BoardUI" utilities or other manual means.
